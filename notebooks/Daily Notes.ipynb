    "Date: April 28, 2025\n",
    "\n",
    "Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Today focused on cleaning up the Raspberry Pi 5 software environment to prepare for proper integration of the Hailo-8 AI accelerator into the Smart Mirror project.\n",
    "\n",
    "Completed Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "Verified installation of hailort and identified broken/incorrect system-wide installation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Confirmed that pyhailort was missing or non-functional.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cleaned up system-wide broken hailort install:\n",
    "\n",
    "Ran sudo apt remove python3-hailort -y to uninstall.\n",
    "\n",
    "Confirmed pip list | grep hailo shows no hailo packages installed in the venv.\n",
    "\n",
    "Discussed and clarified that both hailort (C++ runtime) and pyhailort (Python bindings) are needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Investigated using https://github.com/hailo-ai/hailo-rpi5-examples, found useful for hardware testing but not for providing pyhailort.\n",
    "\n",
    "Plan and Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "Decided to prepare a standalone pyhailort.zip package to install into the smart_mirror_venv.\n",
    "\n",
    "Installation plan after receiving the ZIP:\n",
    "\n",
    "Copy pyhailort.zip to ~/.\n",
    "\n",
    "Extract using unzip pyhailort.zip.\n",
    "\n",
    "Activate virtual environment: source ~/smart_mirror_venv/bin/activate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Navigate to ~/pyhailort/ and install with pip install ..\n",

    "Receive and install the pyhailort.zip package.\n",
    "\n",
    "Validate successful import of pyhailort in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Test minimal face detection integration using Hailo-8 hardware.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "Bookworm OS (Debian 12) on Raspberry Pi 5 presents some compatibility challenges but manageable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disk space usage will be managed carefully (~128GB flash card).\n",
    "\n",
    "rpi5-examples GitHub repo noted for later hardware validation testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next Log Preview:\n",
    "\n",
    "Install pyhailort\n",
    "\n",
    "Test Smart Mirror Main App with face detection loading\n",
    "\n",
    "Final integration of live camera feed with inference using Hailo-8\n",
    "\n",
